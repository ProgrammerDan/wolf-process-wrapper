Wolf External Process wrapper
====

This is a simple process wrapper to allow other languages to compete in the [Wolf challenge on code-golf](http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/q/25347/17546).

Specification
====
Remote scripts are supported by a simple protocol via STDIN and STDOUT hooks, and is split into initialization, Move, and Attack. 
In each case communication with your process will be via STDIN, and a reply is necessary from STDOUT. 
If a reply is not received in 1 second, your process will be assumed to be dead and an exception will be thrown. 
All characters will be encoded in UTF-8, for consistency. Every input will terminate with a newline character, and your process should terminate every output reply with a newline as well. 
**WARNING** Be sure to flush your output buffer after every write, to ensure the Java wrapper sees your output. Failure to flush may cause your remote Wolf to fail.

Note that only a single process will be created, all Wolves must be managed within that one process. Read on for how this spec will help.

###Initialization

**STDIN:** `S<id><mapsize>`\n

**STDOUT:** `K<id>`\n

**`<id>`:** `00` or `01` or ... or `99`

####Explanation:

The character `S` will be sent followed by two numeric characters `00`, `01`, ..., `99` indicating which of the 100 wolves is being initialized. In all future communication with that specific wolf, the same `<id>` will be used.

Following the ID, a variable length sequence of numeric characters will be be sent. This is the size of the map. You'll know the sequence of numeric characters is over when you reach the newline (`\n`). 

To ensure your process is alive, you must reply with the character `K` followed by the same `<id>` you received. Any other reply will result in an exception, killing your wolves.

###Movement

**STDIN:** `M<id><C0><C1>...<C7><C8>`\n

**STDOUT:** `<mv><id>`\n

**`<Cn>`:** `W` or ` ` or `B` or `S` or `L`

**`W`:** Wolf

` `**:** Empty Space

**`B`:** Bear

**`S`:** Stone

**`L`:** Lion

**`<mv>`:** `H` or `U` or `L` or `R` or `D`

**`H`:** Move.HOLD

**`U`:** Move.UP

**`L`:** Move.LEFT

**`R`:** Move.RIGHT

**`D`:** Move.DOWN

####Explanation:

The character `M` will be sent followed by the two character `<id>` to indicate which Wolf needs to choose a move. Following that, 9 characters will be sent representing that Wolf's surroundings, in row order (top row, middle row, bottom row from leftmost to rightmost).

Reply with one of the valid movement characters `<mv>`, followed by the Wolf's two digit `<id>` for confirmation.

###Attack

**STDIN:** `A<id><C>`\n

**STDOUT:** `<atk><id>`\n

**`<C>`:** `W` or `B` or `S` or `L`

**`<atk>`:** `R` or `P` or `S` or `D`

**`R`:** Attack.ROCK

**`P`:** Attack.PAPER

**`S`:** Attack.SCISSORS

**`D`:** Attack.SUICIDE

####Explanation:

The character `A` will be sent followed by the two character `<id>` to indicate which Wolf is participating in an attack. This is followed by a single character `<C>` indicating which type of thing is attacking, either a `W`olf, `B`ear, `S`tone, or `L`ion.

Reply with one of the `<atk>` characters listed above, indicating what your response to the attack is, following by the two digit `<id>` for confirmation.

And that's it. There's no more to it. If you lose an attack, that `<id>` will never be sent to your process again, that's how you will know your Wolf has died -- if a complete Movement round has passed without that `<id>` ever being sent.

Conclusion
====

Note that any exceptions will kill all the Wolves of your remote type, as only a single "Process" is constructed of your remote wolf, for all wolves of your type that get created.

In this repository you'll find the `Wolf.java` file. Search and replace the following strings to set up your bot:

* Replace `<invocation>` with the command line argument that will properly execute your process.

* Replace `<custom-name>` with a unique name for your Wolf.

* For example, I have `WolfRandomPython.java` that invokes my example remote, the `PythonWolf.py`, a Python 3+ Wolf.

* Rename the file to be `Wolf<custom-name>.java`, where `<custom-name>` is replaced with the name you chose above.

To test your Wolf, compile the Java program (`javac Wolf<custom-name.java`), and follow Rusher's instructions to include it in the simulation program. Be sure to provide _clear_, _concise_ instructions on how to compile/execute your actual Wolf, which follows the scheme I've outlined above.

Good luck, and may nature be ever in your favor.
